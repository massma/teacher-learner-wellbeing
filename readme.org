* Required software
  - [[https://www.haskell.org/downloads/#minimal][Haskell GHC compiler and Cabal build tool]]

* Optional software
  - [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]]: by default this will be built from source using GHC, but
    this can take a very long time and make your computer work really
    hard. To avoid that, you can optionally install it using your
    Operating System's package manager.

* Instructions to build the website
  After building, the website will be available in generated html
  files in ~./public_html~, and you can then copy this directory over
  to your webserver to make it available.

  Some of these instructions are a little technical, but it is
  extremely important to us that you materials are accessible, so if
  you would like to build the website please don't hesitate to reach
  out to Adam (akm2203 "at" columbia "dot" edu). Adam is happy to walk
  you through the process and debug any problems with you. You
  are also doing us a favor by reaching out, as it will help us
  improve the build instructions.


** General instructions
   Clone this repository with ~git clone --recursive~, enter
   directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cabal run build
   #+END_SRC

   This will build the website according to default options. However,
   there are also a couple of options that will customize the website
   and build processes.

*** Customize the website with your own links, names, and dates
    You can provide your own configuration file that will customize
    the content generated with your own information. See the file
    ~abby-adam.config~ for an example; you can copy that file and edit
    it to your needs.

    To specify the configuration file run:

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      cabal run build -- --config=abby-adam.config
    #+END_SRC,

    replacing ~abby-adam.config~ with the path to your configuration
    file.

*** Use your installed version of Pandoc instead of building from source

    By default the build system will build ~Pandoc~ from source, which
    can take a very long time. To avoid that, you can tell the build
    system to use your own installed version of Pandoc, if it is
    available for your OS. This can be done with the option
    ~--pandoc~:

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      cabal run build -- --pandoc=/path/to/pandoc
    #+END_SRC,

    replacing ~/path/to/pandoc~ with the path to your OS-installed
    version of Pandoc (e.g., ~/bin/pandoc~ on Linux).


* Contributing content
  All content is generated from files in ~/website-src~. Edit or add
  files here to update website content. The build system will
  automatically generate a new website if you execute the command
  ~cabal run build~.

* Modifying the build system
  The build system is based on [[https://shakebuild.com/][Shake]], and can be modified with the
  ~Shakefile.hs~ file.
