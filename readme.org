* Required software
  -  [[https://www.haskell.org/downloads/#minimal][Haskell GHC compiler and Cabal build tool]]


* Instructions to build the website
  After building, the website will be available in generated html
  files in ~./public_html~.

** Windows (untested)

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cabal run build
   #+END_SRC

** Linux instructions

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cabal run build
   #+END_SRC

   or, with GNU Make:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     make
   #+END_SRC

   This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven't tested it.

* Contributing content
  All content is generated from files in ~/website-src~. Edit or add
  files here to update website content. The build system will
  automatically generate a new website if you execute the command
  ~cabal run build~.

* Modifying the build system
  The build system is based on [[https://shakebuild.com/][Shake]], and can be modified with the
  ~Shakefile.hs~ file.
