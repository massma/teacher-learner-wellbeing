* Required software
  -  [[https://www.haskell.org/downloads/#minimal][Haskell GHC compiler and Cabal build tool]]

* Build instructions
** Windows (untested)

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cabal new-run build
   #+END_SRC

** Linux instructions

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cabal new-run build
   #+END_SRC

   or, with GNU Make:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     make
   #+END_SRC

   This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven't tested it.
