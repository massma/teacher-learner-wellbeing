title: "Read: Choose your own adventure"

After reflecting on our own personal experiences, now is a good
opportunity to dive a little bit into what the literature has to say
about embodied learning. Depending on your interests, please read one
(or more) of the three articles below:

- "[Learning Through the Body](https://elib.umkendari.ac.id/eb_el/Sharan_B._Merriam-Third_Update_on_Adult_Learning_Theory__New_Directions_for_Adult_and_Continuing_.pdf#page=43)" by Tammy J. Freiler.
   - An accessible introduction to embodied learning. Freiler
     discusses how embodiment "involves a sense of connectedness and
     interdependence through the essence of lived experiencing within
     one’s complete humanness, both body and mind, in perceiving,
     interacting, and engaging with the surrounding world. Simply
     stated, embodied learning involves being attentive to the body
     and its experiences as a way of knowing ." Freiler asserts the
     importance of customization and flexibility when implementing
     embodied learning in the classroom—the body is deeply personal
     and everyone has different levels of comfort with it.
   - Note: The article refers to the Moken as "sea gypsies." This
     gives us pause, especially given the use of "Gypsy" as an ethnic
     slur in many cultures (particularly in Europe), and we are
     honestly not sure how to feel about it as applied to the
     Moken. The Moken refer to themselves as Moken. "Sea gypsy" is a
     general term used to describe semi-nomadic people from many
     distinct and diverse cultures and ethnicities in Southeast
     Asia. At a minimum, perpetuating general terms like this is a
     problematic source of erasure of the diverse experiences and
     cultures of the people subsumed by the term. We wish that the
     Moken were just called what they call themselves: Moken. These
     insights were based on some research on the web, but if anyone
     else has any thoughts or perspectives on these terms please share
     so we can learn.
- "[Don't Forget About the Body: Exploring the Curricular Possibilities
  of Embodied Pedagogy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-015-9319-6)" by Nguyen and Larson
  - This review paper is summarized nicely by its conclusions: "We can
    claim that education occurs only when the whole learner constructs
    knowledge and meaning from the experiences we facilitate. Learners
    are simultaneously sensorimotor bodies, reflective minds, and
    social beings. Embodied pedagogy provides a way through which
    alternative forms of teaching and learning can be integrated and
    accepted into the classroom. A curriculum can span disciplines to
    make concrete its visions of creating spaces where learners create
    personal and social meaning with and in the body. When we have
    accomplished this, we have created a holistic curriculum that
    engages the whole learner." The authors cite specific examples
    across disciplines.
  - Subjective comment: the paper felt a little dense at first, but
    felt more accessible as it progressed.
- "[Flexible Space & Built Pedagogy: Emerging IT
  Embodiments](http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/Built%20Pedagogy.pdf)"
  by Torin Monahan
  - Instead of a lot of direct, explicit focus on embodied pedagogy
    and learning, Monahan:
    - discusses how spaces (both virtual and material) shape teaching
      and learning by constraining and encouraging social interaction
      and information exchange;
    - argues that all classes are hybrid; even as we sit in front of a
      zoom screen we are still embodied in whatever place we are
      sitting, and every material classroom and most learners
      (especially these days) carry some technology and virtual space
      with them;
    - emphasizes the importance of collaborative, thoughtful,
      perpetual redesign of learning environments by both students and
      teachers.
  - Subjective comment: it is fascinating to read this in the context
    of the year it was written (2000-2002).
