`FACILITATORS' FULL NAME`

## Discussion Guidelines

1. Listen respectfully without interrupting.
2. Listen actively with an ear to understanding others’ views.

   students and teachers look and feel like?
2. What are the barriers (institutional, psychological, personal,
   etc.) to centering wellbeing in the classroom?
3. What strategies can we, as graduate student instructors,
   incorporate in order to cultivate a classroom community that
   centers mental wellbeing?

“To teach in a manner that respects and cares for the souls of our
students is essential if we are to provide the necessary conditions
where learning can most deeply and intimately begin.”

-bell hooks, *Teaching to Transgress* (13)

## Group Visioning Exercise

Drawing on your personal experience in education and your engagement
with the Canvas module...

## Group Visioning Exercise

Envision a class environment that respects and cares for the souls of
teachers and learners:

- *What does this classroom look like?*
- *How is class time structured?*
- *How do students interact with each other? With the instructor(s)?*
- *How are the directions and methods of learning decided?*
- *What obstacles are keeping us from this ideal?*

Record some takeaways from your conversation in the [collaborative
