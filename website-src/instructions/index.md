title: Facilitators' Instructions for "Considering the Whole Self in Teaching and Learning"
---

### Layout

This workshop is structured as a "Learning Community" split
between two synchronous sessions. Asynchronous prep modules are
designed to enrich the synchronous sessions. The rest of this page
will detail how we implemented the workshop, but feel free to
adapt to your purposes.

### Workshop prep

You will need to put a few things together:

1. Copy our sample community agreement, slides and collaborative
   document over to your Google drive:
   - [Collaborative Document Session
     1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MNI5cris19PANJOVwfO1ulTDXVTP5QNcTBtEP239o5M/edit?usp=sharing)
   - [Collaborative Document Session
     2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Kguon2fR8t5W1ILTJdXRxIScIaJ9GrUkJHxeQkuUeQ/edit?usp=sharing)
   - [Community Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1T8TvVuFR5UGB3tkQnRpxviP8BKMS9X3j1uNLw5QFA/edit?usp=sharing)
   - [Slides Session
     1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i0MdAA8_09FReCYdzoS96aGH5MNhLyhX1MCIoB4OF_k/edit?usp=sharing)
     (optional: you could also use the [reveal.js slides](../presentations/module1.md) that are a
     part of the website)
   - [Slides Session
     2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Lf84GyLN25YLRS9JE1kJZlDDISJZnZ_UeYsSb0g8YE/edit?usp=sharing)
     (optional: you could also use the [reveal.js
     slides](../presentations/module2.md) that are a part of the
     website)

2. Set up an online discussion board of some type. Possible platforms
   include:
   - Piazza
   - CourseWorks/Canvas Discussions
   - Github/Gitlab Issues

   More informal social platforms could also probably be adapted, like
   Keybase Teams/Slack, Signal/WhatsApp, etc.

3. Install the course website
   (https://github.com/massma/teacher-learner-wellbeing) to your
   website. This is a little technical, so if you have any trouble at
   all please reach out to Adam at akm2203@columbia.edu. If you do
   reach out, you are doing us a favor: it will help us refine our
   instructions to make the material more accessible to future
   facilitators.


### Workshop description and blurb

This is what we used for advertising the workshop:

"It is no secret that stress, anxiety, and other mental health
challenges are prevalent in higher education. In fact, in recent
years, more students have reported experiencing negative academic
impacts from stress than from the common cold and flu (c.f., NCHA,
2019). Yet the standard mental health policies we include in our
syllabi often frame these experiences as something to be addressed
solely outside of the classroom. This two-part workshop takes a
different approach, recognizing that instructors and TAs have the
power to support and prioritize students’ (and our own) physical and
mental wellbeing in the classroom, and that doing so can foster
student learning. This re-centering of health and wellbeing is crucial
now more than ever, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic intersect
with and amplify pre-existing stressors for teachers and learners,
including but not limited to anti-Black racism, political turmoil, and
increasingly common climate disasters.

In this two-part workshop, participants will explore the relationships
between mental and emotional health, the human body, and
learning. Through a combination of asynchronous modules and
synchronous workshop and discussion sessions, participants will frame
the literature of mental health and bodily awareness in the classroom
with their lived experience and leave with concrete methods of
incorporating new insights into their own practice, with a particular
focus on creating learning objectives and designing assessments that
consider and support the whole student. These novel approaches will
help students and teachers to experience more positive, rewarding, and
healthy class spaces, and to support each other in working toward this
vision."

### Intro & instruction email

Our initial contact with registrants was through email:

"Welcome to the Learning Community, Considering the Whole Self in
Teaching and Learning: Mental and Physical Wellbeing in the Classroom!
We are really looking forward to seeing you all at `DATE OF WORKSHOP
PART 1` at `LOCATION`, and we wanted to reach out about some prep for
our first get-together:

- Please work through the content in [Module
  1](../workshop/module1.md). This module provides the necessary
  foundation for our discussion-packed Zoom session, allows us to
  shorten the Zoom session (limiting Zoom fatigue), and also jump
  starts community building with an asynchronous discussion board. We
  really hope everyone is able to get a chance to engage with all the
  asynchronous material, but if for whatever reason you are not able
  to complete everything, we still encourage you to post to the
  discussion board and attend the in-person session on `DAY OF
  WORKSHOP PART 1`. Everyone has valuable perspective and expertise to
  bring to our discussions, and while the material will help enrich
  the discussion, we do not want to limit anyone’s participation
  because of a scarcity of time or mental bandwidth.

This session is part of a two-part Learning Community, and the
Learning Community is greater than the sum of its parts. Attendance
across both sessions yields a much richer experience, while also
putting the “community” in “Learning Community.”  We hope to see you
all a the second session as well!

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns please don’t
hesitate to reach out (`FACILITATORS' EMAIL`)."

### Synchronous Session 1

Sample slides are available [in Google slide
format](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i0MdAA8_09FReCYdzoS96aGH5MNhLyhX1MCIoB4OF_k/edit?usp=sharing)
or in [reveal.js](../presentations/module1.md); but most of session
focuses around discussion and the collaborative document (example doc
available
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MNI5cris19PANJOVwfO1ulTDXVTP5QNcTBtEP239o5M/edit?usp=sharing)).

Here is the breakdown of the session, which is about 75 minutes long:

- :00 - :05 INTRODUCTIONS [Slides 1–3]

  Allow people to settle in before giving a very brief introduction:
   - Names and motivation for learning community (Slide 1)
   - The learning community → talk about holistic wellbeing and
   resist “banking model” of education (Slide 1)
   - Community agreement/discussion guidelines  → preferred camera
   on, can participate w/ chat or by speaking (Slide 2)
   - Guiding questions (Slide 3)

- :05 - :10 WARM UP [Slide 4]

  Physical check-in (breath and awareness). Can be any activity, but a
  sample script that we used is available here (TODO: link to script).

- :10 - :15 FRAME BOTH WORKSHOPS

  Presentation: data on mental health in higher education as evidence
  that lack of wellbeing is an issue (Slide 5). hooks' quotation as an
  ideal we are aiming for that can improve wellbeing (Slide 6).

	- Remind participants of what they read in the asynchronous
      modules, frame that they will be using that material in their
      workshops
    - Frame that we will not come into the breakout rooms unless
      invited with the "help" button—we’ll monitor how the discussion
      is progressing based on what you put in the shared doc.
	- We have two main collaborative sessions that we want to get to
      today: one is this visioning exercise, one is a concrete
      application of some principles to the question of assessment in
      the classroom.
    - Introduce visioning exercise (Slide 7). We’ll try to recall
      everyone around 3:15 (3:20) to amplify and share out from the
      visioning exercise
	- Provide recommendation for incorporating the collaborative doc
      into the discussion: take the first 10 minutes or so for
      introductions and the start of the discussion without worrying
      about adding to the document, then consider having one person
      from the group add salient points to the discussion as it
      continues.
    - The instructions for each activity are also visible on the
      collaborative document. You should be receiving a breakout room
      invitations right now.

- :15 - :35 SMALL GROUP VISIONING EXERCISE

	Facilitated discussion of asynchronous reading and reflection activities (small group and share out or full group, depending on numbers)
	  - hooks' quotation  → visioning exercise: what does a classroom that respects and cares for the souls of teachers and learners look like?
        - Participants discuss in small groups and contribute to collaborative document.

- :35 - :40 SHARE OUT

	Bring everyone back together and amplify a couple of entries from
    the collaborative doc before presenting the [TITL
    handout](https://traumainformedteachingblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/examples-of-titl-in-college-classrooms-3.2020-color-3.pdf)
    (Slide 8) and introducing the assessment exercise (screen share
    collaborative document).


- :40 - 1:00 CASE STUDIES: ASSESSMENT WORKSHOP

	Case studies in group work (re-thinking assessment). Discuss a common assessment. What is the:
      1. purpose of the assessment
      2. ideal path to fulfilling the purpose
      3. reality: within current roles how can we intervene to improve
         assessment for student and teacher mental health.

- 1:00 - 1:05 AMPLIFY AND SHARE OUT
   - Definitely amplify from third column of #2
   - (Time allowing) Ask if anyone wants to elaborate on their entries
     on the shared doc.

- 1:05-1:15

  Community feedback and input for next session:

  - Solicit feedback on first session (Slide 9)
    - In light of the guiding questions, rank which modules were most
      rewarding on Poll Everywhere (or any other survey software.
    - (time allowing) type some of your personal answers to the
      Session 1 guiding questions in the chat.
  - (time allowing) Start brainstorming for session 2 (Slide 10)
    - What are some questions people have about embodied learning?
    - (time allowing) solicit responses in chat
    - (otherwise) provide this as a “take home” prompt for discussion on Session 2’s async message board

### Instruction email between synchronous session 1 and 2

We wrote:

"To those that attended `DAY OF WORKSHOP PART 1`’s Learning Community:
thank you again for such an engaging and enriching session. Here is a
link to the collaborative document with all of the beautiful insights
generated from that session:

`LINK TO COLLABORATIVE DOC 1`

To those that could not make it but are joining us for the second
session on `DATE OF WORKSHOP PART 2` - welcome! We are really looking
forward to `DAY OF WORKSHOP PART 2` and exploring the possibilities of
embodied pedagogy in the classroom! A few points before next session:

- We designed [Module 2](../workshop/module2.md) to enrich next `DAY OF WORKSHOP PART 2`’s
  discussion, and we hope you are able to work through the content
  before we meet. However, none of it is required and the overview
  page provides instructions on which activities we recommend
  prioritizing if you are too busy and/or stressed to engage with
  everything.

- The Zoom link will be sent out next week.

- We noticed that some of you mentioned past experience with “warm up”
  exercises like the one that Abby led on Wednesday. If any of you are
  interested in leading next Wednesday’s 5-minute warm up exercise,
  please reach out to Abby or Adam. We’d be thrilled to open up the
  floor!

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns please don’t
hesitate to reach out (`FACILITATORS' EMAIL`).

Most importantly, have a great weekend!"
