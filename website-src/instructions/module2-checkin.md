title: "Embodied check-in script for Module 2"
---
Here is the script (thoughtfully written & led by Abby) for the
embodied check-in during the second synchronous session:

1. Begin by settling in to a comfortable posture: you can lie down,
   stand up, sit down—whatever feels like a comfortable resting
   position for you. Close your eyes, and start breathing deeply.
2. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the air moving into your
   body.
3. As you exhale, send all of the tension in your muscles out with the
   breath. Release the tension from your shoulders, and from your
   stomach, and from your lower back, and from your neck, and from
   between your eyes. Trust the surface you rest on to hold you up,
   and trust gravity to keep you in place. Continue breathing deeply.
4. Over the next three deep breaths, slowly adjust your body so that
   it takes up as little space as possible. Move slowly, and notice
   the sensation of curling in on your self. How compact can you make
   yourself as you continue to breathe?
5. Spend a few breaths here, and notice the inner sensations of your
   body. Can you feel your torso expanding and contracting with your
   breath? Can you feel your heart beating? Has any tension returned
   to your muscles? Notice these sensations, but don’t worry about
   them. Take another deep breath.
6. Over the next several breaths, as slowly and deliberately as you
   can move, expand your body to take up as much room as possible. As
   you unfurl, inhale to note the feeling of your clothes and the air
   moving on your skin, and exhale to send the tension and strain out
   of your expanding limbs, torso, and awareness.
7. Come to stillness at your most spacious self. I invite you now to
   send your awareness into the space around you—what can you hear?
   What can you feel? What can you smell, as the breath continues to
   pass between you and your surroundings? Stay here, expansive and
   noticing, breathing deeply.
8. I invite you now to slowly return to the comfortable position you
   found at the beginning of this exercise. Continue breathing as you
   move, and invite the other participants of this learning community
   into your awareness.
9. Take one final deep, deliberate breath, expelling any remaining
   tension in your body. When you are ready, I invite you to turn your
   camera back on, relaxed and ready to to engage with this community
   that we have created by bringing ourselves to this virtual space
   together.
