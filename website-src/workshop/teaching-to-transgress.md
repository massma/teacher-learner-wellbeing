title: "Read: Teaching to Transgress"
---

While the necessity of addressing student and instructor mental
wellbeing is drawing sharp attention today in the light of
unprecedented global disruption, these concerns have been of central
concern in antiracist pedagogies for a long time.

Read either the "Introduction" or "Engaged Pedagogy" (or both!) from
bell hooks' [*Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of
Freedom*](`LINK TO HOOKS`). As you read, consider how hooks' insights
from 1994 could be applied to increasing student and instructor
wellbeing today, both online and in person. We will engage with some
of her key terms and concepts during the synchronous session
discussion, so feel free to note what interests you most on the
discussion board at the end of this module.
