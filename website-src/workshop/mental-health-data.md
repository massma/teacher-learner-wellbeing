title: "Review: Higher Ed Mental Health Data"
---

Now that we have reflected on our personal experiences with mental
wellbeing, let's examine some general statistics on mental health in
academia gathered from surveys and peer-reviewed research. Flip
through this short slide deckPreview the document and **think about
how the mental health statistics and excerpts from the literature
compare to your expectations based on personal experience** (while
remembering that these numbers and insights are based on surveys and
questionnairesâ€”no metric is perfect or universal). Additionally (and
optionally), consider:

- What does the prevalence of mental health issues say about higher ed's
  institutional and cultural prioritization of student wellbeing?
- How can we, as instructors, TAs, and/or students, intervene?
- Are there institutional structures or norms that prevent you from
  intervening as you would like (e.g., prevent you from implementing
  your "ideal classroom" from the previous module)?
