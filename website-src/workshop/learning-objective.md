title: "Prep: Bring a Learning Objective to Wednesday's Session"
---

Hopefully, scavenging for examples of embodiment in teaching and
learning has us primed to think of some areas in our own fields that
could use some embodied pedagogy.

During next `DAY OF WORKSHOP PART 2`'s session we will workshop how to
use embodied learning to meet a learning objective or improve a lesson
plan relevant to your field. **Please brainstorm a learning objective,
or if you prefer, an entire lesson plan** that you would like to
revise to use embodied learning techniques. At the start of
Wednesday's synchronous Learning Community we will ask you to share
your learning objective so that we can build discussion groups around
similar interests.  Within these groups we will help each other to
brainstorm and workshop interventions that center and engage the body.

However, if you are struggling to think of a learning objective do not
stress: you can still participate in the Learning Community without
one.
