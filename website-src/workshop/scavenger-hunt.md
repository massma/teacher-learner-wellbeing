title: "Embodied Learning Scavenger Hunt"
---

Now that you have an insight into some basic concepts of embodied
pedagogy, try to find an example of its application in teaching and
learning and share it on this [discussion board](`LINK TO DISCUSSION
BOARD`).

This entry can be in any form and at any scale: from an anecdote of
your own experience as a teacher/learner, to a Youtube video of a
learning activity, to a news article about an interesting intervention
in a department or program, to a summary of one of the examples
discussed or cited in the reading you chose or the [additional
resources](additional-resources-2.md), etc.

Include a brief description of the example and the learning goals it
advances, as well as a note about what you find intriguing and/or
challenging about it.

We also encourage you to look through the other entries. Consider
analyzing and commenting on your peers' examples to extend the
conversation, perhaps by making a connection to something in the
reading you chose. These posts and comments will serve as inspiration
for the workshopping we do during the synchronous session.
