title: "Session 2: Considering the Body in Teaching and Learning"
---

Welcome to "Considering the Whole Self in Teaching and Learning" -
part 2!  For this second part of our learning community, we turn to
the body, and how bringing the body into the classroom can help
improve the wellbeing of both students and teachers. Before our
synchronous meeting on **`DATE OF WORKSHOP PART 2`**, please engage
with these online materials and activities, at your leisure and
discretion. They will help lay the groundwork and set the stage for a
discussion-packed zoom session, but if you are feeling too busy or
stressed please do not overextend yourself by engaging with these
modules. You are still welcome at the synchronous session regardless
of module completion. If you can partially engage with the online
modules, please prioritize the "Embodied Learning Scavenger Hunt" in
order to share ideas with the rest of the community, and "Prep: Bring
a Learning Objective to Wednesday's Session," which will help make the
synchronous session run much more smoothly.

This hybrid learning community form is an experiment in designing and
facilitating learning activities in a manner that centers participant
wellbeing, and your feedback is welcome throughout.
