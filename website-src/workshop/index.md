Welcome to the landing page for the workshop "Considering the Whole
Self in Teaching and Learning: Mental and Physical Wellbeing in the
Classroom"! This is a two part workshop, with two synchronous sessions
on `DATE OF WORKSHOP PART 1` and `DATE OF WORKSHOP PART 2`. Before
each synchronous session, we have put together some asynchronous
modules designed to to enrich our synchronous discussions:

- [Module 1: Considering Mental Wellbeing in Teaching and Learning](module1.md) (prep for the session on `DATE OF WORKSHOP PART 1`)

- [Module 2: Considering the Body in Teaching and Learning](module2.md) (prep for the session on `DATE OF WORKSHOP PART 2`)

We look forward to seeing you all soon!
