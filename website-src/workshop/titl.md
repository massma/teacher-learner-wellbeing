title: "Review: Trauma-Informed Teaching and Learning"
---

One concrete set of principles and strategies that can help to center
student and instructor wellbeing in the classroom is trauma-informed
teaching and learning (TITL).

Janice Carello defines TITL as teaching and learning with attention to
"the role that violence and victimization have played in the lives of
many individuals" in order to "use that understanding to improve
policies and practices in order to accommodate the needs of trauma
survivors" (Carello,
["About"](https://traumainformedteaching.blog/about/)).

Look over this
[handout](https://traumainformedteachingblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/examples-of-titl-in-college-classrooms-3.2020-color-3.pdf)
on the principles and practices of TITL. How might we utilize and
adapt these recommendations in our own teaching practice to center
student and instructor wellbeing? This handout and the principles and
strategies on it will inform our conversation and workshopping in the
synchronous session.
