## Session 1: Considering Mental Wellbeing in Teaching and Learning

Welcome to "Considering the Whole Self in Teaching and Learning"! This
is part one of a learning community of graduate students designed to
shift the conversation around teaching and learning toward caring for
our students and ourselves as "whole selves" with emotional and
embodied lives that impact our work in the classroom.

In an effort to mitigate Zoom fatigue, an emotional and embodied
obstacle that many of us are negotiating this semester, this learning
community is designed to be engaged with in a hybrid
asynchronous/synchronous form. This module presents materials relevant
to the conversation around the focus of our first session, mental
wellbeing in teaching and learning, as well as suggestions for how to
engage with those materials. On `DATE OF WORKSHOP PART 1`, we will
meet for a shorter-than-usual synchronous session via Zoom to discuss
the materials and try our hand at putting them into practice.

This hybrid learning community form is an experiment in designing and
facilitating learning activities in a manner that centers participant
wellbeing, and your feedback is welcome throughout.
