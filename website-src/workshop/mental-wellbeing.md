title: "Reflect: Mental Wellbeing"
---

Isaac Prilleltensky defines wellbeing as "a positive state of affairs,
brought about by the simultaneous satisfaction of personal,
relational, and collective needs of individuals, groups, communities,
and societies."

With a focus on mental wellbeing, reflect on your experience in higher
education. Consider some of the following questions in your response:

- How has teaching and learning at the university level impacted your
  mental wellbeing? What challenges have you faced? What challenges
  have your students faced? What classroom conditions contributed to
  these challenges?
- What educational circumstances have led you to feel self-actualized?
- As an instructor, how do you perceive your role in facilitating
  mental wellbeing in the classroom? How have you implemented
  attention to mental wellbeing in the classroom, and what were the
  results?
- In an ideal world, what would a classroom centered on the mental
  wellbeing of students look like? How would it operate?

Your response will not be shared with the group, but you are welcome
to draw on this reflection during discussion, both synchronous and
asynchronous. We recognize that reflecting on mental health can be
painful, so please participate in this reflection as you feel
comfortable, opting out as needed.
