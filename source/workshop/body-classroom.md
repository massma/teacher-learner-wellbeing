title: "Reflect: The Body in the Classroom"
---

Considering some of the following questions, reflect on your
experience of embodied teaching and learning:

- How does your education-related work impact your physical wellbeing?
- When has your embodied knowledge been called-upon in an educational
  setting? Outside of an educational setting?
- As a learner, have you ever been asked to engage your body in the
  learning process? What was your experience of that engagement?
- Under what conditions are you most aware of your physical presence
  as an instructor? Why?
- In your field, how can the body be meaningfully incorporated into
  the teaching and learning process?
- What conditions are required for embodied engagement that is safe
  and accessible for all learners?

It is okay if this reflection brings up even more questions about
embodied pedagogy - for now embrace the unknown, and hopefully the
following materials and Wednesday's synchronous session will help
answer some of these questions!
