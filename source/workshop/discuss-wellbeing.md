idea, question, or short passage that you found compelling in the
resources presented in this module. Include a short reflection about
why it struck you. What concrete practices can we implement to
prioritize mental wellbeing in teaching and learning?

Please read your fellow participants' posts and comment on at least
one to share your own thoughts and experiences and continue
brainstorming. The conversations that begin here will inform our
synchronous session.
